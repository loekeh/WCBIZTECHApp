        <h2>Application Innovation</h2>
    </p>
    <p>As a Business Manager what would you do in each of these three scenarios:</p>
    <p>*    When you are not sure that your current on-premises hosting solutions will support the scale, reliability and cost-efficiency the business demands? </p>
    <p>*    When the existing application needs to evolve to support new ways of working with customers, branches, other offices or stores, while still integrating with the ERP system?</p>
    <p>*    When the Management knows that they will not be able to achieve the level of business agility that they want in the current deployment environment?</p>
    <br />
    <p>The Cloud becomes the preferred choice.  Utilizing Azure Cloud offers the benefits of:</p>
    <p>*    Fast time to market and deployment agility</p>
    <p>*    Cost Savings</p>
    <p>*    Global availability</p>
    <p>*    Elastic Scale Up/Down</p>
    <p>*    Free up I.T. Resources and Realization of Savings.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Another advantage of Azure is that it offers Businesses the option of a Hybrid deployment.  You get to combine on-premises and Azure Cloud  deployments until you feel confident enough to move more workload to the Cloud.</p>
