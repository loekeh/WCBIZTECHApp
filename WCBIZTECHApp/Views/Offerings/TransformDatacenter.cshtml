<p><h3>Software-defined Datacenter</h3></p>
<p>
    With a software-defined datacenter, you gain the ability to manage diverse hardware as a unified resource pool. You get greater flexibility and more resilience. That’s the big thing we’re learning from cloud—that to respond rapidly to the demands of the business, you have to move away from a highly-customized infrastructure to a standardized, automated infrastructure.
</p>

    <h3>
        Service delivery:
    </h3>
</p>
<p>
    How do you get your users the resources they need—whether they are developers or LOB application owners? A great approach to service delivery should allow you add in cloud resources to your infrastructure in a hybrid model, so that you’re automatically drawing capacity. A strong service delivery model also allows you to pre-approve compute/storage/network resources to designated users, so that authorization isn’t a roadblock.
