        <p>
            In the world of big data created by IoT, the proliferation of devices, apps, and services isn’t just about more data. It’s about different data and needing a data platform that can deal with all of it in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlock insights on any data – You and your employees can not only capitalize on all the data your organization is capturing from customers and end users, but also capitalize on the promise of big data – and tap into external data to uncover insights that were previously hidden.  The key here is getting that power in the hands of people who are closest to your customers – the people in your company who need to make decisions about your business on a day-to-day basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, ultimately, doing all of this with a flexible infrastructure that can support a heterogeneous IT environment.
