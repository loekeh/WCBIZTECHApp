<h2>Migration to the Cloud</h2>

<p>
    The Cloud is here. It is a paradigm shift in information technology. It is the Cloud-First, Mobile-First era.  The power of social media, mobile devices, globalization and demand for real-time information access have made traditional Data and Application platforms obsolete.

    Learning Organizations position themselves as Global Players.  This means, they have data centers in different countries; have Mobile Systems that provide real-time access to information wherever and whenever; they have employees and contractors in different regions of the world who need to work together to accomplish common objectives. Their business operations have grown beyond the capacity of their local infrastructure.  They need a platform that is dynamic, resilient, scalable, secure and accessible anywhere. The answer is simply, The Cloud! The Microsoft Cloud Platform. This is why Cloud Migration is the hottest issue in business circles today. Whether it is Servers and Data Migration or Data Center Transformation or Application Innovation, the Cloud welcomes them all.
